Hi Humans!

Joe here, I like RubyOnRails(RoR) -- that's how I like abbeviating it, as well.

I've lived abroad on three different occassions, believe in the 'experience by doing' approach, and will leave you with these words:  "Success is not final. Failure is not fatal. It's the courage to continue that counts."
